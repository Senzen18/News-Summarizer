# News Summarization and Text-to-Speech Application

---

## Overview
This project is a web-based application that extracts key details from multiple news articles related to a given company, performs sentiment analysis, conducts a comparative analysis, and generates a text-to-speech (TTS) output in Hindi.

## Features
- **News Extraction**: Scrapes and displays at least 10 news articles from The New York Times and BBC.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Categorizes articles into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiments.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Groups articles with most semantic similarity. Then compares the groups to derive insights on how a company's news coverage varies.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts the summarized sentiment report into Hindi speech.
- **User Interface**: Provides a simple web-based interface using Gradio.
- **API Integration**: Implements FastAPI for backend communication.
- **Deployment**: Deployable on Hugging Face Spaces.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Gradio
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Scraping**: BeautifulSoup
- **NLP**: OpenAI GPT models, LangChain, Sentence Transformers
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Pre-trained Transformer model
- **Text-to-Speech**: Google TTS (gTTS)
- **Deployment**: Uvicorn, Hugging Face Spaces

---

## Model Details
- **News Extraction:** Implemented using `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Utilizes `mrm8488/deberta-v3-ft-financial-news-sentiment-analysis`.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Uses `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for similarity scoring.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Converts text into Hindi speech using `gTTS`.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Only extracts articles from The New York Times and BBC.
- Requires a valid OpenAI API key for sentiment analysis and comparison.
- Hindi speech output uses gTTS, which requires an internet connection.

## Deployment
### This project is deployed on hugging face spaces. Both Backend and frontend interface are deployed seperately:
### *Make sure to run the fast API link before gradio interface link.*
1. To access the front end gradio click [Gradio Interface](https://senzen-news-summarizer-interface.hf.space)
2. To access the back end Fast API endpoints click [Fast API endpoints](https://senzen-back-end.hf.space)
